# Classification-Brain-Activity
TITLE: Brain Activity Analysis and Machine Learning: Rough Localization of Epileptic Focus in the Cortex.
The aim is to classify the epileptic patients with respect to the part of the brain which is responsible
for the attackes. The raw data is fMRI time series and we will use Deep Learning methods to do the classification task.
Due to data deficiency, the generated network has to be extra small in order to avoid overfitting. Some techniques have been 
taken like One-out technique and MLP input selection.
